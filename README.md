**Overview**

InterviewPrep-AI is a web-based AI platform designed to simulate realistic mock interviews for aspiring Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and related roles. Unlike traditional mock interviews, which provide static questions and delayed feedback, InterviewPrep-AI uses large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), NLP, and deep learning to generate job-specific questions, evaluate responses (text/audio/video), and provide instant, tailored feedback.
It is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS (frontend), Node.js/Express.js (backend), MongoDB/PostgreSQL (database), and Hugging Face/LLM APIs (AI layer), deployed on AWS/Vercel with Docker and Kubernetes for scalability.

**Key Features**
•	Dynamic Question Generation: Context-aware questions tailored to user resumes, job descriptions, and selected roles.

•	Multiple Interview Formats: Technical (coding, SQL, DSA), behavioral (STAR), case studies, HR & soft skills.

•	Multi-Modal Responses: Users can respond via text, audio, or video.

•	Real-Time Feedback: Deep learning & NLP evaluate responses on correctness, clarity, and problem-solving, with personalized improvement tips.

•	Adaptive Interview Flow: AI adapts difficulty and follow-up questions dynamically.

•	Performance Tracking: History of past sessions with analytics to measure progress.

**Tech Stack**

•	Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS

•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js

•	AI Models:

o	Implemented: Mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (fine-tuned for interview Q&A)

o	Proposed: Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3, Gemma 7B, PaLM 2 (for multilingual, STAR evaluation, coding analysis)


•	Data Engineering: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy), Airflow DAGs, GCP Buckets, BigQuery

•	Databases: MongoDB Atlas, PostgreSQL

•	Deployment: AWS, Vercel, Docker, Kubernetes

•	Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

**Project Implementation**

**1. Data Engineering**
   
•	Sources: LeetCode, StrataScratch, Indiabix, GitHub repositories, AmbitionBox, Kaggle, Reddit.

•	Data Types: Technical coding Qs, SQL, DSA, behavioral, HR, and case study questions. (~4500+ unique questions).

•	Preprocessing: Cleaning duplicates, formatting, filtering offensive content, text normalization, stopword removal.

•	Transformations:

o	Difficulty classification (Easy/Medium/Hard)

o	Keyword extraction & sentiment analysis

o	Readability & lexical diversity metrics

o	Feature engineering for ML compatibility

•	Pipeline: Airflow DAGs automated ingestion → preprocessing → transformation → loading into GCP BigQuery.

•	Data Splitting: Stratified train (70%), validation (15%), test (15%).

**2. Model Development**

•	Implemented Model: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (fine-tuned using LoRA).

•	Training: ~5 epochs, GPU with FP16, Hugging Face integration.

•	Evaluation Metrics:

o	ROUGE-1: 0.44, ROUGE-2: 0.29, BLEU: 0.20

o	Uniqueness ratio: 97.5% (diverse answers)

o	Average answer length close to human baseline.

•	**Example Outputs:** Technical & behavioral answers matched human-like clarity & coherence.


**Future Models:**

•	Qwen 2.5 → Long context, multilingual interviews.

•	Gemma 7B → Real-time follow-up Qs.

•	LLaMA 3 (405B) → Advanced coding/SQL analysis.

•	PaLM 2 → STAR-based behavioral evaluation.

**3.System Architecture**

•	Frontend: Resume/JD upload, role selection, response mode selection (text/audio/video).

•	Backend: Builds prompts → sends to LLM → processes feedback → stores results.

•	Data Flow:
1.	User input → API call → LLM generation

2.	AI evaluates and generates feedback

3.	Responses & scores stored in Firestore/BigQuery

4.	Results visualized for performance tracking

**4. Deployment & Scalability**
   
•	Containerization: Dockerized model services.

•	Scaling: Kubernetes orchestrates microservices.

•	Hosting: Frontend on Vercel/Firebase, backend on AWS/GCP.

•	Monitoring: Grafana dashboards for latency, accuracy, and uptime.

**Applications**

•	Job Seekers: Practice domain-specific interviews and improve performance.

•	Recruiters: Use AI-assisted evaluation for candidate assessment.

•	Academia: Integrate with career coaching & bootcamps.

•	Corporate Training: Support employee upskilling & leadership assessment.

**Future Enhancements**

•	Multi-language support.

•	Integration with video analysis (facial expressions, emotions).

•	Gamified interview practice.

•	Advanced analytics dashboards for recruiters & trainers.

**Conclusion**

InterviewPrep-AI is an LLM-powered interview simulator that blends data engineering, NLP, deep learning, and cloud deployment to provide personalized, real-time interview preparation. By combining adaptive question generation, multimodal evaluation, and instant feedback, it sets a new benchmark in career preparation platforms.
